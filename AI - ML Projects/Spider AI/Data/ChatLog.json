Please note that this figure may have changed since my knowledge cutoff and may not reflect the current net worth of Elon Musk.\n\n**2. What is Python?**\n\nPython is a **high-level, interpreted programming language**. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. It is often used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n\n**3. What is Photosynthesis?**\n\nPhotosynthesis is the **process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds, such as glucose**. This process occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which contain the pigment chlorophyll. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth, as it provides energy and organic compounds necessary to support the food chain. The overall equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2"
